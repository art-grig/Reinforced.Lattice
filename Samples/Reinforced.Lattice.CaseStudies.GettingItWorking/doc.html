    <h2>Case</h2>
    <p>
        You have heard about Reinforced.Lattice somewhere. Or your colleague told to you about that and you decided to try.
        Or your boss have directed you to embed it to the project because he has heard somewhere that it is
        cool and handy to use. However, you are here and want to start with Reinforced.Lattice. <br />
        Read carefully, follow the steps and here we go.
    </p>
    <h2>Solution</h2>
    <h3>Step 1 - Download and install</h3>
    <p>
        Let's assume that you already have ASP.NET MVC5 project and also you have some DB connected to it. It must be behind
        ORM supporting LINQ and IQueryables. If you do not have database - you can use any other data source supplying IQueryable
        of some entitites you want to display. <br />
        I will provide examples using
    <code>User</code> class as my source entity that I want to display and also <code>UserRow</code>
    class acting like POCO ViewModel (<a href="#code_DataClasses" data-inpage>show</a>).
        If you do not have ViewModel - create it just as you <span class="tip" data-tip="vm">regulary create ViewModels for MVC forms</span>.
        Of course, you can do it later.
        <br />
        Go to your NuGet Package Manager Console and type there:
    </p>
</div>
<pre class="pm-console">
    PM > Install-Package Reinforced.Lattice.Bundle.Mvc5
    </pre>
<div class="text">
    <p>
        Or you can use Visual Studio NuGet's Ui if you like it. <br />
        Reinforced.Lattice bundle package will bring several important things:
    </p>
    <ul class="blogger-sans">
        <li><b>Reinforced.Lattice core library</b> itself</li>
        <li><b>Client script</b> to be used on your pages</li>
        <li><b>Huge templates page</b> containing default datagrid template for Twitter Bootstrap made by me</li>
        <li><b>Reinforced.Lattice.Mvc5</b> library that contains extensions for its requests handling via Mvc5</li>
        <li><b>Reinforced.Lattice.Mvc5.Razor</b> library with some handy extensions for Razor templating</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Remember all these components - we will use them later</p>
    <h3>Step 2 - Connect scrpt</h3>
    <p>Now go to your master page (usually, <code>_Layout.cshtml</code>) and paste following lines to your <code>&lt;head&gt;</code>  tag:</p>
</div>
<pre class="language-cshtml wrap-code">
<code>
&lt;script type="text/javascript" src="~/Scripts/Reinforced.Lattice/reinforced.lattice.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt; </code><br />
<code>
@RenderSection("scripts", required: false)
</code>
</pre>
<div class="text">
    <p>
        Compare with <a href="#code__Layout_cshtml" data-inpage>my one</a> if you're not sure. We will need this "scripts" section later. It is critically important for
        it to follow <b>after</b> Reinforced.Lattice script connection.
    </p>
    <h3>Step 3 - Prepare your page ViewModel</h3>
    <p>
        Then we have to create ViewModel for your entity set of which you are going to display within datagrid.
    </p>
</div>

<div class="text tiptext" data-tiptext="vm" data-caption="About ViewModels">
    <p>
        Reinforced.Lattice ViewModels are of course are little bit different than regular MVC forms ViewModels.
        E.g. you do not have to put arrays of <code>SelectListItem</code>s to it. Also complex nested types are not allowed there.
        Optimal way is to keep you ViewModel for Lattice as <b>flat</b> and as plain-est as possible. Try to put actually all the fields
        that you are displaying to there. Of course, Lattice works with nested types, but it <i>may</i> reduce performance.
